AN00246: Simple USB Audio Device using lib_xua
##############################################

********
Overview
********

The XMOS USB Audio (XUA) library provides an implemention of USB Audio Class versions 1.0 and 2.0.

This application note demonstrates the implementation of a basic USB Audio Device on
the xCORE.ai Multichannel (MC) Audio board (XK-AUDIO-316-MC).


***************************************
USB Audio to IÂ²S example using lib_xua
***************************************

The CMakeLists.txt file
=======================

To start using the XMOS XUA library, you need to add ``lib_xua`` to the dependent module list
in the CMakeLists.txt file. This application note uses the ``lib_board_support`` software
repository to provide common code to configure the xCORE.ai Multichannel (MC) Audio board for
use. This should also be added to the list of dependent modules in the CMakeLists.txt file::

  set(APP_DEPENDENT_MODULES "lib_xua"
                            "lib_board_support")

The dependencies for this example are specified by ``deps.cmake`` in the ``examples`` directory
and are included in the application ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

The ``lib_xud`` library requires some flags for correct operation. Namely the
tile on which ``lib_xud`` will be executed, for example::

  set(APP_COMPILER_FLAGS ... -DUSB_TILE=tile[0] ...)

The ``lib_board_support`` requires a compiler flag to select the hardware type::

  set(APP_COMPILER_FLAGS ... -DBOARD_SUPPORT_BOARD=XK_AUDIO_316_MC_AB ...)

Includes
========

This application requires the system header that defines XMOS xCORE specific
defines for declaring and initialising hardware:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: include <xs1.h>
   :end-before: include "xua.h"

The XUA library functions are defined in ``xua.h``. This header must
be included in your code to use the library. Headers are also required for
``lib_xud`` and the board setup code for the xCORE.ai Multichannel Audio board.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: include "xua.h"
   :end-at: include "xk_audio_316_mc_ab/board.h"

Declarations
============

Allocating Hardware Resources
-----------------------------

A basic implementation of a USB Audio device (i.e. simple stereo output via I2S)
using ``lib_xua`` requires the follow pins:

    - I2S Bit Clock (from xCORE to DAC)
    - I2S L/R clock (from xCORE to DAC)
    - I2S Data line (from xCORE to DAC)
    - Audio Master clock (from clock source to xCORE)

.. note::

    This application note assumes xCORE is I2S bus master

In the xCORE architecture the I/O pins are controlled and accessed by ``ports``. The application therefore declares various ``ports``
for this purpose:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: /* Port declaration
   :end-at: in port p_mclk_in

``lib_xua`` also requires two ports for internally calculating USB feedback. Please refer to
the ``lib_xua`` library documentation for further details.  The additional input port for the master
clock is required since USB and S/PDIF do not reside of the same tiles on the xCORE.ai MC Audio Board.

These ports are declared as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: /* Resources for USB feedback
   :end-at: in port p_mclk_in_usb

In addition to ``port`` resources two clock-block resources are also required:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: /* Clock-block
   :end-at: clock clk_audio_mclk_usb

Again, for the same reasoning as the master-clock ports, two master-clock clock-blocks are required
- one on each tile.


Other Declarations
------------------

``lib_xua`` currently requires the manual declaration of tables for the endpoint types for
``lib_xud`` and the calling the main XUD function in a par (``XUD_Main()``).

For a simple application the following endpoints are required:

    - ``Control`` endpoint zero
    - ``Isochonous`` endpoint for each direction for audio data to/from the USB host

These are declared as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: /* Endpoint type tables
   :end-at: XUD_EpType epTypeTableIn

Hardware Setup
==============

Some code is needed to perform the hardware-specific setup for the board being used
in this application note.

The ``xk_audio_316_mc_ab_config_t`` structure is used to specify hardware-specific
configuration options, such as clocking modes and frequencies.

The ``i_i2c_client`` unsafe client interface is required to have a globally-scoped variable
for gaining access to the ``i2c_master_if`` interface from the audio hardware functions.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: /* Board configuration from lib_board_support */
   :end-at: unsafe client interface i2c_master_if i_i2c_client

The following functions are called by ``XUA_AudioHub`` to configure the hardware; they are
defined as wrapper functions around the board-specific code from ``lib_board_support``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: void AudioHwInit()
   :end-before: int main()



The Application main() Function
===============================

The ``main()`` function sets up the tasks in the application.

Various channels/interfaces are required in order to allow the required tasks to communicate.
These must first be declared:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: /* Channels for lib_xud
   :end-at: interface i2c_master_if i2c[1]

The rest of the ``main()`` function starts all of the tasks in parallel
using the xC ``par`` construct:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-at: par
   :end-before: return 0

This code starts the low-level USB task, an Endpoint 0 task, an Audio buffering task and a task to handle
the audio I/O (i.e. I2S signalling).

It also runs ``xk_audio_316_mc_ab_board_setup()`` and ``xk_audio_316_mc_ab_i2c_master()`` from ``lib_board_support``
that are used for setting up the hardware.

Configuration
=============

``lib_xua`` has many parameters than can be configured at build time, some examples include:

    - Sample-rates
    - Channel counts
    - Audio Class version
    - Product/Vendor IDs
    - Various product strings
    - Master clock frequency

These parameters are set via defines in an optional ``xua_conf.h`` header file. For this simple application the contents
of this file might look something like the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/xua_conf.h
   :start-at: // Copyright
   :end-at: #endif

Some items have sensible default values, items like strings and sample rates for example. However, some items are specific to a hardware
implentation e.g. master clock frequencies and must be defined.  Please see the ``lib_xua`` library documentation for full details.

Building the Application
========================

The following section assumes you have downloaded and installed the `XMOS XTC tools <https://www.xmos.com/software-tools/>`_
(see `README` for required version). Installation instructions can be found `here <https://xmos.com/xtc-install-guide>`_.
Be sure to pay attention to the section `Installation of required third-party tools
<https://www.xmos.com/documentation/XM-014363-PC-10/html/installation/install-configure/install-tools/install_prerequisites.html>`_.

The application uses the `xcommon-cmake <https://www.xmos.com/file/xcommon-cmake-documentation/?version=latest>`_
build system as bundled with the XTC tools.

The ``AN00246_xua_example`` software zip-file should be downloaded and unzipped to a chosen directory.

To configure the build run the following from an XTC command prompt::

    cd examples
    cd AN00246_xua_example
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B build

Finally, the application binaries can be built using ``xmake``::

    xmake -C build

Demo Hardware Setup
===================

To run the demo, use a USB cable to connect the on-board xTAG debug adapter (marked ``DEBUG``) to your development computer.
Use another USB cable to connect the USB receptacle marked ``USB DEVICE`` to the device you wish to play audio from.

Plug a device capable of receiving analogue audio (i.e. an amplified speaker) to the 3.5mm jack marked ``OUT 1/2``.

Launching the Demo Application from the command line
====================================================

Once the demo example has been built from the command line using ``xmake``
it can be executed on the xCORE.ai MC Audio Board.

Once built there will be a ``bin/`` directory within the project which contains
the binary for the xCORE device. The xCORE binary has a XMOS standard .xe extension.

From the command line you use the ``xrun`` tool to download and run the code
on the xCORE device::

  xrun ./bin/app_xua_simple.xe

Once this command has executed the application will be running on the
xCORE.ai MC Audio Board

Running the Application
-----------------------

Once running the device will be detected as a USB Audio device - note, Windows operating
systems may require a third party driver for correct operation
